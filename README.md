## COVID-19 DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS: UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN THE PHILIPPINES

### Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has induced one of the worst jobs crises because of the Great Depression.  The chance to public health, the financial and social disruption threatens the long-time period livelihoods and wellness of hundreds of thousands There is an actual risk that the disaster will grow poverty and widen inequalities, with the effect felt for years to come. Policies to protect people from employment dangers and enhance new employment possibilities are urgently needed. Countries need to do the whole lot they could to prevent this jobs disaster from becoming a social disaster.

Prior to the COVID-19 epidemic, the Philippines was enjoying its longest period of economic and job growth in history. Wage and pay employment (a measure of modern employment) grew at an annual rate of 4.6 percent on average from 2015 to 2019. Unfortunately, the pandemic wiped approximately 1.7 million wage and salary jobs in the year leading up to January 2021, reversing some of these advances. The informal sector, on the other hand, added roughly 435,000 jobs. The epidemic could have long-term employment implications. Simply said, even when the economy has begun to recover again, this transient significant shock to the economy may result in a consistently lower employment rate. Hysteresis in the workplace is the term for this phenomenon.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippines' jobless rate has dropped to its lowest point. According to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), over 420,000 Filipinos lost their jobs in 2020 as businesses closed due to COVID-19. In January 2021, the number of people who lost their jobs nearly doubled. By January 2021, four million Filipinos have lost their jobs, up from 2.4 million in January 2020. Nobody can be entirely prepared to be in this situation. Joblessness has not only financial consequences for a family, but it also has psychological and psychological consequences.The National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) found that during the early stages of the epidemic, calls to its self-destruction hotline increased, with concerns about joblessness and financial instability among the top concerns.

The epidemic increased growing inequities between skilled and unskilled employees, harming both low- and middle-skilled people whose jobs are threatened by automation or relocation. Informal employees, self-employed workers, temporary workers, and migrant workers were among the most at risk.


### SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

GOAL 1: NO POVERTY
Poverty is rooted on unemployment and underemployment. For the destitute, labor is frequently their sole means of improving their situation. As a result, creating productive job opportunities is critical for poverty reduction and long-term economic and social development. It is critical to offer respectable jobs for the underprivileged, particularly women and young people, that provide both income and empowerment. 


GOAL 2: DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
The belief that good labor is the best path to socioeconomic progress, poverty elimination, and personal happiness is emphasized in a social perspective on development. The creation of better and more productive occupations, particularly those that can absorb large numbers of working poor, should be prioritized. Investing in labor-intensive industries, notably agriculture, promoting a shift in employment structure toward higher-productivity occupations and sectors, and increasing work quality in the informal economy are all important factors in creating such jobs. Furthermore, disadvantaged persons should be given priority in gaining the necessary skills and assets to properly benefit from any growth in job prospects.


### Problem Statement

The Covid 19 pandemic has resulted a signifucant increase in unemployment/jobloss, the non-standard forms of employmwnt and informal workers situation led to low morale and self esteem, high stress and also anxiety on overthinking problem on their work and also added family problem or personal problem. The total death in Covid 19 can also be one of the problem why people/worker lost jobs because the company or other business branches started to lesten the number of worker on their bussiness to prevent to be infected by the virus. The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are not the same for all workers. It is the vulnerable workers who find it increasingly more difficult to adverse impact on their quality of life

The pandemic of Covid 19 hits the most  Philippines harder than other counties. The global lockdown due to the virus is the strictes in the world that all of the people were affected especially on their jobs, many people lost their job tend to lost income and to start also the increase of poverty.

### Significance of the Proposed Project

The following will benefit from the study's findings:
The given data would guide citizens of the US, particularly job workers, to have a deeper understanding about this study and for them to know what the things to do are in times of unemployment.

These findings will benefit Batangas State University in providing technical knowledge that will be useful in achieving research objectives, especially in technological sectors. This research could be useful in teaching College of Information Technology faculty members about information technology concepts and hypotheses, as well as other pertinent areas.

These findings will benefit Students at the College of Information Technology to help them develop new understanding. Future Researchers: This study will use this project as a starting point for future relevant project research. They will be able to research and learn about how this type of technology can aid in the tracking of Covid-19 victims' and unemployed workers' data.


### Methods
People's health, jobs, and rights have all been affected by the epidemic. The Duterte administration's inept pandemic reaction appears to have increased rather than alleviated Filipinos' misery. The unemployment rate is 8.8%, or 4.2 million individuals, according to the government's labor force survey dated February 2021. The greatest unemployment rate was observed at 17.6 percent during the first implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine in April 2020.


Aside from mass layoffs from shuttered firms, thousands are placed on 'floating status,' meaning they have no work and no pay during the outbreak. They are not officially classified as jobless because they are waiting for firms to "recover" before returning to work. The Department of Labor and Employment extended the floating status, which had previously been limited to six months, for another year.


### Expected Output
During the pandemic, our topic, "Covid-19 Descriptive Analysis: Information and Impact on Employment," is likely to result in community planning and unemployment support. The unification of persons who reside in the same region is required for a better community. To establish a better organization, people must follow the rules and regulations. To help the unemployed, create a software that will train or teach them how to execute a task. Unemployed individuals will benefit from free training, which will help the pandemic survive. A freelancing seminar is essential to develop the skills needed to aid the unemployed. They will earn from the goods since it will sell. The most important factor is to assist employees in growing the company.
