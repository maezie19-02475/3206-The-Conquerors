### Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak has triggered one of the biggest job crises since the Great Depression. The crisis has the capacity to cause unemployment and widen inequities, 
with long-term effects. The coronavirus outbreak, which began in February 2020, wreaked havoc on the American labor market, increasing the unemployment rate to new highs
and displacing millions of people.


The newly released report by the UN system's and supranational organizations' Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA) provides a snapshot of data
and statistics on how COVID-19 is affecting the world today, from economic and environmental fluctuations to changes in income, education, employment, domestic violence,
and more. It examines vulnerable subpopulations in different countries, regions, and subpopulations. COVID-19 is an unprecedented crisis that affects all aspects of our
lives, according to the report.

### Problem Statement

The corona virus disaster has caused two types of employment loss such as temporary lockdown-induced job loss and permanent impact job loss. Temporary job loss due to lockdown in the country for two months was estimated to be in between 12 and 17 million (Ahmed & Kamal, 2020a). Shutdown of the major four sectors in the economy has created this job loss. Seven million jobs in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, five million jobs in the transport sector, three million jobs in the construction sector and more three million jobs in the manufacturing sector were disappeared temporarily (The Financial Express, 2020). 

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 4.3 million confirmed cases and over 290,000 deaths globally. It has also sparked fears of an impending economic crisis and recession. Social distancing, self-isolation and travel restrictions have lead to a reduced workforce across all economic sectors and caused many jobs to be lost. Resulting economic fallout caused significant hardship. In the early months of the crisis, tens of millions of people lost their jobs. While employment began to rebound within a few months, unemployment remained high throughout. Improving employment and substantial relief measures helped reduce the very high levels of hardship seen in the summer.
