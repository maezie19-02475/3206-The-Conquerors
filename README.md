## COVID-19 DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS: UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN THE PHILIPPINES

### Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has induced one of the worst jobs crises because of the Great Depression.  The chance to public health, the financial and social disruption threatens the long-time period livelihoods and wellness of hundreds of thousands There is an actual risk that the disaster will grow poverty and widen inequalities, with the effect felt for years to come. Policies to protect people from employment dangers and enhance new employment possibilities are urgently needed. Countries need to do the whole lot they could to prevent this jobs disaster from becoming a social disaster.

Prior to the COVID-19 epidemic, the Philippines was enjoying its longest period of economic and job growth in history. Wage and pay employment (a measure of modern employment) grew at an annual rate of 4.6 percent on average from 2015 to 2019. Unfortunately, the pandemic wiped approximately 1.7 million wage and salary jobs in the year leading up to January 2021, reversing some of these advances. The informal sector, on the other hand, added roughly 435,000 jobs. The epidemic could have long-term employment implications. Simply said, even when the economy has begun to recover again, this transient significant shock to the economy may result in a consistently lower employment rate. Hysteresis in the workplace is the term for this phenomenon.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippines' jobless rate has dropped to its lowest point. According to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), over 420,000 Filipinos lost their jobs in 2020 as businesses closed due to COVID-19. In January 2021, the number of people who lost their jobs nearly doubled. By January 2021, four million Filipinos have lost their jobs, up from 2.4 million in January 2020. Nobody can be entirely prepared to be in this situation. Joblessness has not only financial consequences for a family, but it also has psychological and psychological consequences.The National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) found that during the early stages of the epidemic, calls to its self-destruction hotline increased, with concerns about joblessness and financial instability among the top concerns.

The epidemic increased growing inequities between skilled and unskilled employees, harming both low- and middle-skilled people whose jobs are threatened by automation or relocation. Informal employees, self-employed workers, temporary workers, and migrant workers were among the most at risk.


### SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

GOAL 1: NO POVERTY
Poverty is rooted on unemployment and underemployment. For the destitute, labor is frequently their sole means of improving their situation. As a result, creating productive job opportunities is critical for poverty reduction and long-term economic and social development. It is critical to offer respectable jobs for the underprivileged, particularly women and young people, that provide both income and empowerment. 


GOAL 2: DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
The belief that good labor is the best path to socioeconomic progress, poverty elimination, and personal happiness is emphasized in a social perspective on development. The creation of better and more productive occupations, particularly those that can absorb large numbers of working poor, should be prioritized. Investing in labor-intensive industries, notably agriculture, promoting a shift in employment structure toward higher-productivity occupations and sectors, and increasing work quality in the informal economy are all important factors in creating such jobs. Furthermore, disadvantaged persons should be given priority in gaining the necessary skills and assets to properly benefit from any growth in job prospects.


### Problem Statement

The coronavirus led to two types of employment losses: a temporary lockdown-induced job loss that was only temporary, and a permanent job loss that was a major issue. Many people are not permitted to walk outside during the pandemic and have lost their jobs as a result of the policies that must be followed. This is a major issue, particularly for those with families and children who require assistance.Unemployment or job loss can actually impact a person's mind and body by causing depression or stress because they will overthink their problem. It is also hard to find a job, especially now that there is a global epidemic because other people are not able to leave the house and there are only a few jobs available because people cannot stay close to each other.

Over 4.3 million confirmed cases and 290,000 deaths have been reported worldwide as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. One issue that workers are dealing with is the loss of personal jobs as a result of the worldwide pandemic. There are persons who are having difficulty obtaining work, as well as those who have been fired from their former job. The impact on all workers is that they may get unhappy and anxious as a result of their unemployment, and their families may suffer as a result of them taking money for their daily requirements at work. Some people work in construction because it is the only easy employment available, but the pay is insufficient to meet the family's needs, and the job is also demanding.


### Significance of the Proposed Project

The following will benefit from the study's findings:
The given data would guide citizens of the US, particularly job workers, to have a deeper understanding about this study and for them to know what the things to do are in times of unemployment.

These findings will benefit Batangas State University in providing technical knowledge that will be useful in achieving research objectives, especially in technological sectors. This research could be useful in teaching College of Information Technology faculty members about information technology concepts and hypotheses, as well as other pertinent areas.

These findings will benefit Students at the College of Information Technology to help them develop new understanding. Future Researchers: This study will use this project as a starting point for future relevant project research. They will be able to research and learn about how this type of technology can aid in the tracking of Covid-19 victims' and unemployed workers' data.


### Methods
It refers to the researchers' meticulous design of a study in order to ensure that the findings are reliable and dependable, as well as that they address the study's goals and objectives. The descriptive analysis method was applied in this inquiry. Economic activity, jobs, and our way of life were all affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these events have the ability to significantly affect one's subjective well-being. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the different ways in which the pandemic has impacted the global labor market and workplace, as well as to look at the long-term effects on employees' well-being all over the world.

Many people have had to curtail their hours of work as a result of the pandemic, even if they are still employed. As a result, examining total hours worked declines provides a comprehensive view of the labor market's impact throughout the crisis. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), global working hours decreased by 17.3 percent in the second quarter of 2020, resulting in the loss of 495 million full-time jobs. By the end of the year, average labor losses were approximately four times larger than during the Great Recession in 2009. In 2020, global labor income is anticipated to decline by 8.3%, resulting in a USD 3.7 trillion loss.

These changes are predicted to have a significant influence on happiness. According to most research, those who are unemployed are 5 to 15% less satisfied with their life than those who are employed. On a scale of 0-10, unemployed workers are 0.6 points less happy than their full-time counterparts, according to the 2017 edition of our poll. Full-time employees in Western Europe and North America are said to be 1.11 and 1.31 points happier with their life than unemployed people, respectively. In comparison to other life events, becoming unemployed is also less susceptible to long-term well-being adaptation.

### Expected Output
Our topic, "Covid-19 Descriptive Analysis: Information and Impact on Employment," is expected to result in community planning and assistance to the unemployed during the pandemic. A better community necessitates the unification of those who live in the same area. People must obey the rules and regulations in order to form a better group. The strategy for assisting the unemployed is to develop a program that will train or teach them how to perform a task. Free training for unemployed people will aid in the pandemic's survival. To assist the unemployed, a freelancing seminar is required to learn the skills. The product will sell, and they will be able to profit from it. The best key is to support the people  in growing the business that they build.
