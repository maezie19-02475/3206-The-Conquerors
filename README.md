## COVID-19 DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS: INFORMATION AND IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT

### Introduction
The COVID-19 epidemic has caused one of the biggest job crises since the Great Recession. The crisis has the potential to raise unemployment and widen inequities, both of which will have long-term implications. The coronavirus pandemic, which began in February 2020, wreaked havoc on the American job market, driving unemployment to new highs and displacing millions of people.


The Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA) of the United Nations system and supranational organizations recently released a report that provides a snapshot of data and statistics on how COVID-19 is negatively impacting the world today, from environmental and economic variances to changes in income, education, employment, domestic violence, and more. It looks at vulnerable groups in various countries, regions, and subpopulations. According to the research, COVID-19 is an extraordinary issue that has an impact on all parts of our lives.

Many Americans were affected more than others as the COVID-19 issue spread throughout the economy. Women's unemployment rose quicker than men's during the Great Recession, reversing a previous tendency. Jobs were more likely to be lost by young people, those with less education, Hispanic women, and immigrants. Single parents reported a greater decline in employment than other parents, and reduced workers reported a particularly steep drop.

During the coronavirus-driven crisis, millions of workers of all ages lost their jobs across the United States, but the economic impact on young people was significantly more severe. Not only have many young people in this country had to deal with the agony of returning to school without having in-person classes at their colleges and high schools, but the employment market has also been bad. Young people have historically been negatively impacted in a variety of ways during economic downturns, but the current recession has been particularly severe due to the economy's hardest-hit sectors. Furthermore, despite significant reforms to the unemployment insurance system, many people have effectively been barred from getting unemployment benefits.


### Problem Statement

The coronavirus led to two types of employment losses: a temporary lockdown-induced job loss that was only temporary, and a permanent job loss that was a major issue. Many people are not permitted to walk outside during the pandemic and have lost their jobs as a result of the policies that must be followed. This is a major issue, particularly for those with families and children who require assistance.Unemployment or job loss can actually impact a person's mind and body by causing depression or stress because they will overthink their problem. It is also hard to find a job, especially now that there is a global epidemic because other people are not able to leave the house and there are only a few jobs available because people cannot stay close to each other.

Over 4.3 million confirmed cases and 290,000 deaths have been reported worldwide as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. One issue that workers are dealing with is the loss of personal jobs as a result of the worldwide pandemic. There are persons who are having difficulty obtaining work, as well as those who have been fired from their former job. The impact on all workers is that they may get unhappy and anxious as a result of their unemployment, and their families may suffer as a result of them taking money for their daily requirements at work. Some people work in construction because it is the only easy employment available, but the pay is insufficient to meet the family's needs, and the job is also demanding.


### Significance of the Proposed Project

The following will benefit from the study's findings:
The given data would guide citizens of the US, particularly job workers, to have a deeper understanding about this study and for them to know what the things to do are in times of unemployment.

These findings will benefit Batangas State University in providing technical knowledge that will be useful in achieving research objectives, especially in technological sectors. This research could be useful in teaching College of Information Technology faculty members about information technology concepts and hypotheses, as well as other pertinent areas.

These findings will benefit Students at the College of Information Technology to help them develop new understanding. Future Researchers: This study will use this project as a starting point for future relevant project research. They will be able to research and learn about how this type of technology can aid in the tracking of Covid-19 victims' and unemployed workers' data.


### Methods
It refers to the researchers' meticulous design of a study in order to ensure that the findings are reliable and dependable, as well as that they address the study's goals and objectives. The descriptive analysis method was applied in this inquiry. Economic activity, jobs, and our way of life were all affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these events have the ability to significantly affect one's subjective well-being. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the different ways in which the pandemic has impacted the global labor market and workplace, as well as to look at the long-term effects on employees' well-being all over the world.

Many people have had to curtail their hours of work as a result of the pandemic, even if they are still employed. As a result, examining total hours worked declines provides a comprehensive view of the labor market's impact throughout the crisis. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), global working hours decreased by 17.3 percent in the second quarter of 2020, resulting in the loss of 495 million full-time jobs. By the end of the year, average labor losses were approximately four times larger than during the Great Recession in 2009. In 2020, global labor income is anticipated to decline by 8.3%, resulting in a USD 3.7 trillion loss.

These changes are predicted to have a significant influence on happiness. According to most research, those who are unemployed are 5 to 15% less satisfied with their life than those who are employed. On a scale of 0-10, unemployed workers are 0.6 points less happy than their full-time counterparts, according to the 2017 edition of our poll. Full-time employees in Western Europe and North America are said to be 1.11 and 1.31 points happier with their life than unemployed people, respectively. In comparison to other life events, becoming unemployed is also less susceptible to long-term well-being adaptation.

### Expected Output
Our topic, "Covid-19 Descriptive Analysis: Information and Impact on Employment," is expected to result in community planning and assistance to the unemployed during the pandemic. A better community necessitates the unification of those who live in the same area. People must obey the rules and regulations in order to form a better group. The strategy for assisting the unemployed is to develop a program that will train or teach them how to perform a task. Free training for unemployed people will aid in the pandemic's survival. To assist the unemployed, a freelancing seminar is required to learn the skills. The product will sell, and they will be able to profit from it. The best key is to support the people  in growing the business that they build.
