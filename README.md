### Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak has triggered one of the biggest job crises since the Great Depression. The crisis has the capacity to cause unemployment and widen inequities, 
with long-term effects. The coronavirus outbreak, which began in February 2020, wreaked havoc on the American labor market, increasing the unemployment rate to new highs
and displacing millions of people.


The newly released report by the UN system's and supranational organizations' Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA) provides a snapshot of data
and statistics on how COVID-19 is affecting the world today, from economic and environmental fluctuations to changes in income, education, employment, domestic violence,
and more. It examines vulnerable subpopulations in different countries, regions, and subpopulations. COVID-19 is an unprecedented crisis that affects all aspects of our
lives, according to the report.

The COVID-19 downturn impacted some Americans more than others as it spread throughout the economy. Unemployment rose faster among women than among men, reversing the trend seen during the Great Recession. Job losses were particularly higher among young adults, those with less education, Hispanic women, and immigrants. Unmarried mothers reported a greater decline in employment than other parents, and low-wage employees saw a particularly significant drop in employment.

Millions of workers of all ages lost their employment across the United States during the coronavirus-driven crisis, but the economic effect on young people was far more severe. Not only have many young people in this country had to deal with the painful reality of going back to school without in-person classes at their colleges and high schools, but the job market has also been terrible. Historically, young people have been severely affected in many ways during economic downturns, but this recession has been exceptionally severe due to the parts of the economy that have been hit the hardest. Furthermore, many people have been effectively banned from receiving unemployment benefits, despite considerable changes to the unemployment insurance system.

### Problem Statement

The corona virus disaster has caused two types of employment loss such as temporary lockdown-induced job loss and permanent impact job loss. Temporary job loss due to lockdown in the country for two months was estimated to be in between 12 and 17 million (Ahmed & Kamal, 2020a). Shutdown of the major four sectors in the economy has created this job loss. Seven million jobs in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, five million jobs in the transport sector, three million jobs in the construction sector and more three million jobs in the manufacturing sector were disappeared temporarily (The Financial Express, 2020). 

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 4.3 million confirmed cases and over 290,000 deaths globally. It has also sparked fears of an impending economic crisis and recession. Social distancing, self-isolation and travel restrictions have lead to a reduced workforce across all economic sectors and caused many jobs to be lost. Resulting economic fallout caused significant hardship. In the early months of the crisis, tens of millions of people lost their jobs. While employment began to rebound within a few months, unemployment remained high throughout. Improving employment and substantial relief measures helped reduce the very high levels of hardship seen in the summer.


### Significance of the Proposed Project

This study would have far more significance for the school, students, and society as a whole. It is a fact that any study is conducted not only because a problem exists, but also because the problem is considered or relevant to a specific individual.

The following will benefit from the study's findings:

The given data would guide citizens of the US, particularly job workers, to have a deeper understanding about this study and for them to know what the things to do are in times of unemployment.

This study will aid Batangas State University in giving technical information that may be valuable in fulfilling research goals, particularly in technological fields. This study may be excellent information for teaching concepts or hypotheses connected to Information Technology, as well as other relevant subjects, to College of Information Technology faculty members.

This study will provide information to College of Information Technology students that will aid them in creating new understanding. Future Researchers: This project will be used as a foundation for future relevant project research by this study. They will be able to study and learn about how this type of technology will help them in tracking records of Covid-19 Victims and Unemployed Workers .
