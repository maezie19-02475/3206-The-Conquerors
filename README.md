## COVID-19 DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS: INFORMATION AND IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT

### Introduction
The COVID-19 epidemic has caused one of the biggest job crises since the Great Recession. The crisis has the potential to raise unemployment and widen inequities, both of which will have long-term implications. The coronavirus pandemic, which began in February 2020, wreaked havoc on the American job market, driving unemployment to new highs and displacing millions of people.


The Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA) of the United Nations system and supranational organizations recently released a report that provides a snapshot of data and statistics on how COVID-19 is negatively impacting the world today, from environmental and economic variances to changes in income, education, employment, domestic violence, and more. It looks at vulnerable groups in various countries, regions, and subpopulations. According to the research, COVID-19 is an extraordinary issue that has an impact on all parts of our lives.

Many Americans were affected more than others as the COVID-19 issue spread throughout the economy. Women's unemployment rose quicker than men's during the Great Recession, reversing a previous tendency. Jobs were more likely to be lost by young people, those with less education, Hispanic women, and immigrants. Single parents reported a greater decline in employment than other parents, and reduced workers reported a particularly steep drop.

During the coronavirus-driven crisis, millions of workers of all ages lost their jobs across the United States, but the economic impact on young people was significantly more severe. Not only have many young people in this country had to deal with the agony of returning to school without having in-person classes at their colleges and high schools, but the employment market has also been bad. Young people have historically been negatively impacted in a variety of ways during economic downturns, but the current recession has been particularly severe due to the economy's hardest-hit sectors. Furthermore, despite significant reforms to the unemployment insurance system, many people have effectively been barred from getting unemployment benefits.


### Problem Statement

The corona virus resulted two types of job losses, one is the temporary lockdown-induced job loss for a short period of time and a permanent job loss that is really be a big problem. During this pandemic many of the people are not allowed to go outside and also have a job loss because there are policy that they need to follow. This is a big problem specially to the people who has family and children who need to be supported. Unemployment or job loss can also affect the mind and body of a person because it can cause depression or stressed because they will overthink their problem and it is difficult to find a job especially now that there is a pandemic because other people are not allowed to leave the house and there are only limited jobs that can be entered because people cannot stay close to each other.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 4.3 million confirmed cases and over 290,000 deaths globally. The one problem that the workers are facing is the intimate job lossess because of the global pandemic. There were people that is difficult in finding job and their are also who are removed from their previous job. The impact of this to all workers can affect themselves because they can be depressed and stressed due to unemployment and especially to their families because at work they take money for their daily needs. There are people who work in constructions because it is the only easy job but its salary is still not enough to supply the needs of the family and this job is also quite difficult for a person.


### Significance of the Proposed Project

This study would have far more significance for the school, students, and society as a whole. It is a fact that any study is conducted not only because a problem exists, but also because the problem is considered or relevant to a specific individual.

The following will benefit from the study's findings:

The given data would guide citizens of the US, particularly job workers, to have a deeper understanding about this study and for them to know what the things to do are in times of unemployment.

This study will aid Batangas State University in giving technical information that may be valuable in fulfilling research goals, particularly in technological fields. This study may be excellent information for teaching concepts or hypotheses connected to Information Technology, as well as other relevant subjects, to College of Information Technology faculty members.

This study will provide information to College of Information Technology students that will aid them in creating new understanding. Future Researchers: This project will be used as a foundation for future relevant project research by this study. They will be able to study and learn about how this type of technology will help them in tracking records of Covid-19 Victims and Unemployed Workers .


### Methods
Methods
It refers to the researchers' methodical design of a study in order to ensure that the results are accurate and reliable, as well as that they address the research's goals and objectives. The descriptive analysis strategy was utilized for this study. The COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching effects on economic activity, jobs, and our way of functioning. All of these shocks, in turn, have the potential to have a significant impact on subjective well-being. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the different ways in which the pandemic has impacted the global labor market and the world of work, as well as to look into the long-term effects on workers' well-being around the world. The table shows, many workers who have lost jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic are not actively looking for new jobs, and are thus classified as "inactive" or "out of the labor force" in official statistics. In fact, increases in inactivity have outpaced increases in unemployment in the majority of countries. According to data from the international job site Indeed.com, the trend in job posts fell by more than 50% in many nations in April and stayed significantly below 2019 patterns through the end of the year.

Many workers have had to curtail their working hours as a result of the pandemic, even if they are still employed. As a result, looking at total hours worked reductions provides a complete view of the crisis' impact on the labor market. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), global working hours decreased by 17.3 percent in the second quarter of 2020, resulting in the loss of 495 million full-time jobs. By the end of the year, total working hour losses were roughly four times greater than during the Great Recession in 2009. In 2020, global labor income fell by 8.3%, resulting in a USD 3.7 trillion loss.

These modifications are expected to have a major impact on happiness. Most studies show that individuals who are unemployed are 5 to 15% less content with their lives than those who are employed. In the 2017 edition of our survey, we discovered that unemployed workers are on average 0.6 points less satisfied than their full-time counterparts on a scale of 0-10. Full-time workers in Western Europe and North America are reported to be 1.11 and 1.31 points more pleased with their lives than those who are unemployed, respectively. In comparison to other life circumstances, becoming unemployed is also less sensitive to well-being adaption over time.

### Expected Output
The expected output of our topic entitled "Covid-19 Descriptive Analysis: Information and Impact on Employment" is planning for a better community and helping the unemploy people during this pandemic. A better community means the people living in one community need to be united. To have a better group, the people must follow the rules and regulations. The plan in helping the unemploy people is to create a program that will train or teach them to do a product. Having free training for the unemployed people will help to survive the pandemic. To help the unemployed person needs to have a seminar on freelancing to know the skills. The product will be selling, and they can earn from this. Support the people is the best key to growing the business that they build.
